# Blockchain Data

Blockchain has the potential to change the way that the world approaches data. Develop Blockchain skills by understanding the data model behind Blockchain by developing your own simplified private blockchain.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

### Configuring your project

- Use NPM to initialize your project and create package.json to store project dependencies.
```
npm init
```
- Install crypto-js with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install crypto-js --save
```
- Install level with --save flag
```
npm install level --save
```
- Install Express with --save flag
```
npm install express --save
```

## Testing

To test code:
1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.
2: Enter a node session, also known as REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop).
```
node
```
3: Copy and paste your code into your node session
4: Instantiate blockchain with blockchain variable
```
let blockchain = new Blockchain();
```
5: Generate 10 blocks using a for loop
```
for (var i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  blockchain.addBlock(new Block("test data "+i));
}
```
6: Validate blockchain
```
blockchain.validateChain();
```
7: Induce errors by changing block data
```
let inducedErrorBlocks = [2,4,7];
for (var i = 0; i < inducedErrorBlocks.length; i++) {
  blockchain.chain[inducedErrorBlocks[i]].data='induced chain error';
}
```
8: Validate blockchain. The chain should now fail with blocks 2,4, and 7.
```
blockchain.validateChain();
```

## EndPoints

POST Block/:body
POST Block Endpoint
Post a new block with data payload option to add data to the block body. The block body should support a string of text. The response for the endpoint should provide block object in JSON format.

Response
The response for the endpoint should provide block object in JSON format.

Example POST response
For URL: http://localhost:8000/block

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
cache-control: no-cache
content-length: 238
Connection: close
{"hash":"ffaffeb2330a12397acc069791323783ef1a1c8aab17ccf2d6788cdab0360b90","height":1,"body":"Testing block with test string data","time":"1531764891","previousBlockHash":"49cce61ec3e6ae664514d5fa5722d86069cf981318fc303750ce66032d0acff3"}
Validation
When posting to localhost:8000/block without any content on the payload, your service should not create a block. Be sure to validate if there is content in the block before creating and adding it to the chain.




GET Block/:blockheight

GET Block Endpoint
Configure a GET request using URL path with a block height parameter. The response for the endpoint should provide block object is JSON format.

URL
http://localhost:8000/block/[blockheight]

Example URL path:
http://localhost:8000/block/0, where '0' is the block height.

Response
The response for the endpoint should provide block object is JSON format.

Example GET Response
For URL, http://localhost:8000/block/0
